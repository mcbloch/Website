# Website

This is a nanoc project to generate my site 
([mcbloch.github.io/Website/](https://mcbloch.github.io) and 
[me.mcbloch.dev](https://me.mcbloch.dev)).

## Deploy with

    bundle exec nanoc
    bundle exec nanoc deploy
    
This will push a production build to the `gh-pages` branch which the `github-pages` workflow of Github will pick up.
