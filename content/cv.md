resource: "#me"
name: Maxime Bloch
description: Motivated to learn, eager to discover. 
  I see work when it needs to be done and will proactively search for improvements.
  Working in a team and taking responsibility is a second nature 
  given my years of volunteering experience.

  Engagement in projects about hardware, networking, security and operating systems
  gave me a good understanding how everything works together.

  My current expertise can be found in web development, infrastructure and cloud; 
  and I'm hoping to extend this list in the upcoming years.
