    description: The Cybersecurity Challenge Belgium is, as the name implies, a challenge revolving around cybersecurity. Students over the age of 18 are invited to solve as many challenges as possible, in a capture-the-flag like competition. Every step, the highest-scoring teams make it to the next step. The winners of the finals get (among other prizes) a trip to DEFCON in Las Vegas. In 2022, my team "tetramonohedrons" won and got to take home the victory.
